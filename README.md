# Flash-Act
_A Reaction-time-based 1v1 game_

Flash-Act is a challenging multiplayer JavaScript game where you test your reaction time against your friends. The goal is simple: be the first to hit a button as close as possible to the end of a song. The player with the fastest reaction time scores a point, and the game will continue for multiple rounds until a winner is determined.
